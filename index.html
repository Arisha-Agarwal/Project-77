<p>Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.</p>
    <p>The console screen is used to display whatever we write in the console.log. For opening it, we just have to right click on the page and choose the option "Inspect" and from there we can open console. It will even show what mistake is there in which line. To write something in console we just have to use this format- console.log("whatever you want to write")</p>
